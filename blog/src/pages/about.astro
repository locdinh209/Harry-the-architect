	<h2>👋 Hey, I'm Harry</h2>
	
	<p>
		I'm an architect who builds intelligent systems. My focus is on 
		<strong>Multi-Agent AI</strong>—designing systems where specialized AI agents 
		work together to solve complex problems.
	</p>

	<p>
		With a background in enterprise data platforms and cloud architecture, 
		I bring a practical lens to AI. I'm interested in patterns that actually 
		work in production, not just in demos.
	</p>

	<h3>What I Write About</h3>
	<p>
		This blog explores the intersection of software architecture and AI systems:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How to design multi-agent orchestration</li>
		<li>When to use RAG vs Skills vs Persona</li>
		<li>Building quality gates into AI workflows</li>
		<li>Lessons from production systems</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>
		I've spent over a decade working in <strong>Finance and Banking</strong>, 
		building data platforms and leading technical initiatives. These days, 
		I'm focused on making AI systems more reliable, maintainable, and useful.
