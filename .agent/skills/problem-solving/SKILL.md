# Problem Solving Skills

Advanced techniques for tackling difficult problems.

## When to Use

- Stuck on a complex problem
- Need a fresh perspective
- Want to break out of mental patterns
- Facing analysis paralysis

## Techniques

| Technique | When to Use | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Collision Zone Thinking | Connecting disparate ideas | [collision-zone-thinking/](collision-zone-thinking/) |
| Inversion Exercise | Solving by inverting the problem | [inversion-exercise/](inversion-exercise/) |
| Meta Pattern Recognition | Finding higher-level patterns | [meta-pattern-recognition/](meta-pattern-recognition/) |
| Scale Game | Zoom in/out for perspective | [scale-game/](scale-game/) |
| Simplification Cascades | Reducing complexity step by step | [simplification-cascades/](simplification-cascades/) |
| When Stuck | Escape routes from dead ends | [when-stuck/](when-stuck/) |

## Quick Decision Guide

```
Problem feels impossible
    ↓
Tried obvious approaches? → No? → Try them first
    ↓ (yes, still stuck)
Is problem well-defined? → No? → [simplification-cascades]
    ↓ (yes)
Need new perspective? → [inversion-exercise] or [scale-game]
    ↓
Looking for connections? → [collision-zone-thinking]
    ↓
Seeing patterns? → [meta-pattern-recognition]
    ↓
Still stuck? → [when-stuck]
```

## Background

These techniques originated from the Amplifier project's research into effective problem-solving strategies for complex software challenges.
